  We'll now cover the basics and start by learning movement.
  If you move the mouse the mouse around, you should see the following cursor:<br />
  <img src="../../assets/ui/cursors/move-tile.png" /><br />
  When this cursor appears, it means that you're in movement mode. Click anywhere to
  go start a movement.
</p>

<p>
  There are two movement modes: <b>walking</b> and <b>running</b>. Clicking once somewhere will trigger
  walking. Clicking twice will trigger running.

  <b>What to do next ?</b><br/>
  The next part of the tutorial involves the door, up ahead. Move over there to move on the next part of the tutorial.
