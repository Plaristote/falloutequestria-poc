  Careful in there ! This room is full of traps.

<p>
  When walking around in someone else's lair, you gotta be mindful of potential traps. Don't run around carelessly: traps will reveal themselves to you, sooner or later, depending on your character's <i>perception</i>.
</p>

<p>
  You can just walk around the traps... but if you want to improve your safety, you can also try to disarm those. To do so, open the skilldex with the <b>S</b> key, select the <i>traps</i> skill, and click on one of the landmines. Careful, if you're not proeficient enough, it might explode right in your face !

  <i>Traps are interactive objects. But don't expect those to be highlighted in interactive mode, unless they've already been detected.</i>
