  Congratulations ! You've reached the end of this tutorial.
</p>

<p>
  Ahead of you, you'll see that the ground has a brownish tint to it. This hints you about the presence of an exit zone. Walking into an exit zone will teleport you somewhere else..
</p>

<p>
  There are two types of exit zones :<br/>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="file:assets/tutorials/tutorial/exit-zone-local.png" />
      </td>
      <td>
        Local exit zones will take you to another level, or to another place in the same level.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="file:assets/tutorials/tutorial/exit-zone-global.png" />
      </td>
      <td>
        Worldmap exit zones will take you back to the worldmap.
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</p>

<p>
  Move forward into the brownish tiles to go to the <i>Worldmap</i>.
