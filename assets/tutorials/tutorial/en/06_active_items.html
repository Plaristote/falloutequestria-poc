  The two gray rectangles in the middle of the HUD show your currently available quick actions.

  This is what we call the HUD:<br/>

</p>

<p>
  As you have currently no items equiped, your quick actions are both melee attacks. You can use those to kill the rats:
</p>

<p>
  Move next to one of the rat. Then click on one of the quick actions to enable it. The rat should now be highlighted in red. Move the cursor above the rat next to you: a percentage should appear. It tells you how likely you are to succeed. Click on the rat to trigger the action.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Action point cost</b><br/>
  The amount of action points that will be expanded when using an action is displayed on the bottom-right of the quick use button.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Use modes</b><br/>
  Some items can be used in various ways (such as <i>reloading</i> for a gun). You can circle through the available use modes by right-clicking over the quick use button.
