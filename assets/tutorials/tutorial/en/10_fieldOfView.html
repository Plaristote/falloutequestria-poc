  Rats ahead ! They're still far away, so they might not see you: rats have a pretty low <i>Perception</i> stat.
</p>

<p>
  Your <i>Field of view</i> has a range and a refresh rate, both defined by your <i>Perception</i>. Any character that enters your field of view will become visible to you, as long as you have a line of sight with it. Afterwards, it will take some time for you to lose track of a character once it leaves your field of view.

<p>
  <i>Keep in mind that field of views work the same way for you as they do for non-playing characters.</i>

  <b>Sneaking to avoid detection:</b><br/>
  You can avoid enemies by using the <i>Sneak</i> skill. Press the <i>S</i> key and select the corresponding skill to start sneaking. A small warning box in the bottom-left of the corner is shown when sneaking is enabled.
</p>

<p>
  When you are sneaking, enemies will have a harder time detecting you. But depending on factors such as distance, their perception and your sneak skill, they might manage to detect you... and if they do, combat will start.
</p>

<p>
  Note that you <u>cannot run while sneaking</u>. If you start running, enemies will detect you as soon as you enter the range of their field of view.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Covers:</b><br/>
  Elements such as low walls, doorways, or windows, can be used as cover. Not only do they reduce the chance of hitting through those, they also increase your chances of avoiding detection from enemies.
