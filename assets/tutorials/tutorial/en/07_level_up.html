<p>
  Congratulations ! You won your first combat !
</p>

<p>
  We've rewarded you with additional experience, to show you how leveling up works.
</p>

<p>
  Leveling up grants you <i>skill points</i>, and occasionally <i>perks</i>.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Skill points:</b><br/>
  You can use skill points to improve your skills, making it more likely for you to succeed when performing various type of actions: lockpicking a door, using your unarmed, melee or ranged attacks, etc.<br/>
  Some skills will also open up new dialog options with some NPCs (this is mostly true for the Speech skill).
</p>

<p>
  <b>Perks:</b><br/>
  Perks give your character specific bonuses. They are gained every few levels (depending on your race and traits),
  and more of them will become available as your character's skills improve.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Character sheet:</b><br/>
  To assign your skill points or perks, you'll need to open your character sheet
  On the HUD, clik on the <b>CHAR</b> button, left of the quick use buttons.
</p>

<p>
  When perks are available, a pop-up will appear to let you pick one.<br/>
  Skills are displayed on the right-hand of the interface: click on the +/- buttons to assign your available skill points. Skills you are proficient in (highlighted in yellow) will improve twice as fast as your other skills.
