<p>
  The door is locked.
</p>

<p>
  There are always several ways to solve an issue. When confronted to a locked door, you could look for corresponding key, or try to blast it open with explosives, or try to pick the lock.
</p>

<p>
  Open your skilldex using the <b>S</b> key, and select the <i>lockpick</i> skill.
</p>

<p>
  You should now be in <i>target</i> mode, and the cursor should look like this:<br/>
  <img src="../../assets/ui/cursors/target.png" width="50" height="50" />
</p>

<p>
  While in target mode, click on the door to trigger the action you picked beforehand. Your character will then try to reach the door, and attempt to lockpick it.
</p>

<p>
  If you do not succeed on first try, you can always try again. But beware : if you end up breaking the lock, the only solution left will be to blast the door.
