  Combat mode has been enabled !
</p>

<p>
  When enemies have sighted you, or when you take aim with one of your attacks, combat mode gets enabled. Once your turn come, any action you take will cost a given amount of action points. Your available action points are represented by the dots on the top of the HUD:<br/>
  <table width="100%">
    <tr>
      <td width="50%">Available</td>
      <td width="50%">Used</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><img src="../../assets/ui/ap-active.png" width="25" height="25" /></td>
      <td><img src="../../assets/ui/ap-inactive.png" width="25" height="25" /></td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  <b>Attacking a rat:</b><br/>
  You do not have a weapon right now, so we will first learn how to kill a rat using your unarmed attacks. Start by moving in contact to the nearest rat:<br/>

  Then, select one of your two quick actions, in the middle of the HUD:<br/>

  You should now be in <i>target mode</i>. Aim at the rat you want to hit, and click it:<br/>

  The percentage showing next to the target cursor hints at how likely it is that you'll manage to successfully hit the target.

  <b>Ending your turn</b><br/>
  If you are out of actions to take, but still have some remaining action points, you can also pass your turn by clicking the <i>Pass turn</i> button.<br/>
