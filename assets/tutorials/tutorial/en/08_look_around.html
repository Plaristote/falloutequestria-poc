  Don't know where to go next ?
</p>

<p>
  Visibility isn't always great. You might've missed something. When you're at a loss for where to go next, you can always switch to <i>interaction</i> to have the nearby interactive objects highlighted.
</p>

<p>
  Use a right-click to enable <i>interaction</i> mode.<br/>
  Use another right-click to go back to <i>movement</i> mode.
