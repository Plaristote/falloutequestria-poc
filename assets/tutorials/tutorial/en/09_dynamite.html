  Having a hard time picking that lock ? Maybe it's time to use a more radical type of key.
</p>

<p>
  There is dynamite stored in the locker behind. Pick it up in your inventory, and head towards the door you want to blast open.
</p>

<p>
  Open your inventory by clicking on the "INV" button, above the "CHAR" button, or by pressing thye <b>I</b> key.

<p>
  From your inventory, click on the dynamite item: a list of available interactions appear on the right (inspect, use, drop). Click on <i>use</i> to set the countdown on the dynamite.
</p>

<p>
  <i>Be careful: your ability to properly set up the dynamite depends on your <u>traps</u> skill. If you're not proeficient enough in that skill, you might very well blow yourself up.</i>

<p>
  Once the countdown is set, click on <i>drop</i> to drop the dynamite right in front of the door. All that remains for you to do is to take cover and wait for the dynamite to explode.
